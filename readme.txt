***Cross Browser Compatibility:*** BumpIn chat rooms and widgets are compatible with all major browsers.

***Smooth Transition within a website:*** The new widget remembers you and your conversations while you surf through different pages on a website. So you don't have to worry about staying on a page while chatting. Besides you dont miss a message as you are properly notified about them on browser/tabs

***Better interaction options (public & private) for your visitors:*** With the seamlessly integrated ShoutBox you can participate in public discussions as well as share your interest in Private one-to-one chat (which remembers your conversation even if you refresh of change to some other page in the same website).

***Page level user availability:*** This one is my favorite. The chat widget shows page level users as well as website level users. Its extremely interesting as most of the websites (web 2.0 or older, content based etc.) have clear segmentation between the hosted content. This helps your users to reach out exact people for fruitful interaction as they know who is interested in the same content they are.

***Bumpin Hotspots:*** The feature currently appears in BumpIn Sidebar (which can be reached by going at [BumpIn](http://www.bumpin.com/ "BumpIn Website") website). This is important if you plan to have this widget on your website. We have plans to enhance this feature even more so that it can be more helpful in promoting related website as per user trends.

***Logged In Users:*** From version 3.2 onward, logged in users are detected and their nick name is set in the chat widget automatically.

We would recon that the bloggers (specially) and other sites like forums/content driven sites (generally) to try it out, this can add significant social element.
